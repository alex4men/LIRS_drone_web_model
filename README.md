Web application of our awesome, security drone simulator

To get started, you need to do the following:
1. install git and [meteor](http://meteor.com) on your local machine.
2. `git clone [github_link]` — clone this repo to your local machine
3. `cd [repo_dir]`
4. `meteor npm install` — to install all packages to your local machine
5. run `meteor` in console and then open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, in order to check that everything works fine

If you want to implement some feature:
1. `git checkout develop` — it is recommended to derive your feature from the develop branch
2. `git pull` — don't forget to refresh your local repo!
3. `git checkout -b [feature_<some_meaningful_feature_name>]` — create and switch to a new branch. It is recommended to call it like "feature_<some_meaningful_feature_name>"
4. ONLY NOW you can code your feature
5. `git add .` — stage all your work for commit
6. `git commit -m "<Describe_what_you_have_done>"` — commit changes
7. `git push --set-upstream origin [feature_<some_meaningful_feature_name>]` — to push your local branch to the github
